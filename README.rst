paylogic-jenkins-plugins
========================

Some Jenkins plugins we developed at Paylogic.
These are currently still in development, so no guarantees there.


Plugins do the following:

- Fogbugz: a Java interface to the Fogbugz 7 XML API.
- FogbugzPlugin: a Jenkins plugin that reports build status to Fogbugz using 'Fogbugz'
- AdvancedMercurialManager: a Java class that executes update, commit and merge commands for Mercurial. Parses output of that as well.
  Also provides a task that pushes branches put in Redis by Gatekeeper/Upmerge plugins.
- GatekeeperPlugin: a Jenkins plugin that merges a feature branch to a release branch (meant to run before tests).
- UpmergePlugin: a Jenkins plugin that merges current release branch to next release branch until there are no further releases available.
