TODOs
=====

- pull feature branch from user repository?

- customization options (releasebranch class, lowprio)
- Actions for upmerge and gatekeeper, like the FB case link (lowprio)

- Jenkins does not seem to like macros in the repo subdir option.
  So you need to provide your subdir as a String parameter, as well put in in your SCM settings (do not use the parameter there)
- Remove reference to HgExe

- Split plugins into seperate repositories.
- tests with mock stuff
